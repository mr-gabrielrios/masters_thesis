\section{Summary of the thesis}

Time to get philosophical and wordy.

{\bf Important}: In the list of references at the end of thesis, abbreviated journal and conference titles aren't allowed. Either you must put the full title in each item, or create a List of Abbreviations at the beginning of the references, with the abbreviations in one column on the left (arranged in alphabetical order), and the corresponding full title in a second column on the right.  Some abbreviations, such as IEEE, SIGMOD, ACM, have become standardized and accepted by librarians, so those should not be spelled out in full.
